# Documentation Update Policy

## Hard Rules

- ALWAYS update documentation after significant code changes
- Review ALL documentation files when core functionality changes
- Update README.md to reflect current implementation state
- **MANDATORY**: Update `.cursor/memory/active-context.md` for EVERY implementation task (see [@active-memory.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/active-memory.mdc))
- Remove outdated information immediately when discovered
- Keep documentation synchronized with codebase reality

## Active Context Integration

The `.cursor/memory/active-context.md` file serves as the **single source of truth** for
current development status to prevent duplicate work and maintain project
awareness. This is part of the active memory system described in [@active-memory.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/active-memory.mdc).

### Automatic Context Updates Required

**MUST update `.cursor/memory/active-context.md` when:**

1. **Starting any new implementation task**
   - Document what's being worked on
   - Record current state and progress
   - Note any blockers or dependencies

2. **After implementing new features**
   - Update completed work status
   - Document new components/services created
   - Note any architectural changes

3. **After modifying existing features**
   - Document changes made
   - Update feature status
   - Note any breaking changes

4. **When encountering issues or blockers**
   - Document problems found
   - Update workaround solutions
   - Note follow-up tasks needed

5. **Before starting work** (Critical Anti-Duplication Step)
   - Read `.cursor/memory/active-context.md` first
   - Check if work is already in progress or completed
   - Avoid reinventing the wheel

### Active Context File Structure

The `.cursor/memory/active-context.md` should include:

```markdown
# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
- **Active Task**: [Current implementation]
- **Status**: [In Progress/Completed/Blocked]
- **Started**: [Date/Time]
- **Expected Completion**: [Date/Time]

## Recent Work Completed
- [List of recently completed items with dates]

## Work In Progress
- [List of current tasks with status]

## Known Issues & Solutions
- [Document problems and their solutions]

## Next Steps
- [Planned upcoming work]

## Architecture Notes
- [Recent architectural decisions/changes]
```

## Implementation Workflow Integration

### Pre-Implementation Checklist

1. **Read `.cursor/memory/active-context.md`** - Check if work is already done/in progress
2. **Check git history** - Verify recent changes and patterns
3. **Identify scope** - Determine documentation impact
4. **Update context** - Document what you're about to work on

### During Implementation

- **Update context regularly** - Mark progress and note issues
- **Document decisions** - Record architectural or design choices
- **Track dependencies** - Note blocking issues or external dependencies

### Post-Implementation Checklist

1. **Update `.cursor/memory/active-context.md`** with completed work
2. **Review documentation hierarchy** and update as needed
3. **Verify all examples and instructions still work**
4. **Remove obsolete content**
5. **Update README.md** if user-facing changes

## Triggers

- After implementing new features or major changes
- When modifying core architecture or workflows
- After adding/removing dependencies or services
- When deployment procedures change
- After updating API endpoints or data models
- When git commits introduce breaking changes
- **Before starting ANY implementation work**

## Documentation Hierarchy (update in order)

1. **`.cursor/memory/active-context.md`** - Current development status (ALWAYS FIRST - see [@active-memory.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/active-memory.mdc))
2. **README.md** - Main project overview and quick start
3. **`.cursor/memory/architecture.md`** - System design and component relationships (see [@active-memory.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/active-memory.mdc))
4. **`.cursor/memory/requirements.md`** - Project goals and specifications (see [@active-memory.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/active-memory.mdc))
5. **API documentation** - Endpoint specs and examples
6. **Setup guides** - Installation and configuration steps

## Decision Check (before completing any task)

- **CRITICAL**: Have I read `.cursor/memory/active-context.md` to check for existing work?
- Have I made changes that affect user setup or usage? → Update README.md
- Have I modified core architecture? → Update `.cursor/memory/architecture.md`
- Have I changed APIs or data models? → Update API documentation
- Have I added new features? → Update user guides and examples
- **HAVE I updated `.cursor/memory/active-context.md` with current work status?**

## Quality Standards

- All commands and examples MUST be tested and working
- Use clear, concise language following GitHub markdown best practices
- Respect the markdown lint best practices when creating documentation
- Include code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
- Provide context for why things work the way they do
- Link related sections and external resources appropriately
- **Maintain consistent timestamping in active-context.md**

## Prohibited

- Starting implementation without reading `.cursor/memory/active-context.md`
- Leaving `.cursor/memory/active-context.md` out of date
- Creating duplicate functionality without checking documentation first
- Leaving outdated setup instructions
- Including broken or untested examples
- Generic placeholder content
- Inconsistent information between docs
- Missing critical setup steps or dependencies

## Anti-Duplication Strategy

This documentation policy specifically prevents:

- Reinventing already completed features
- Working on tasks already in progress
- Missing architectural decisions made by other work
- Creating duplicate implementations
- Wasting time on solved problems

**Remember: Always read the active context first (see [@active-memory.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/active-memory.mdc)), then work, then update it.**
