# Active Memory Rule

## Purpose

Maintain current session context and work-in-progress state. This system tracks **what you're doing now** and **what's next**, not historical records (see [@archive-memory.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/archive-memory.mdc) for history).

## Memory Location

All active memory files are stored in `.cursor/memory/`

## Core Files

### 1. Active Context (`.cursor/memory/active-context.md`)

Current session state and immediate work focus.

**Contains:**

- What you're working on right now
- Recent changes in this session
- Current blockers or issues
- Next immediate steps (1-3 actions)

**Update when:**

- Starting a new work session
- Switching between tasks
- Hitting a blocker
- Ending a session

### 2. Requirements (`.cursor/memory/requirements.md`)

Living document of system goals and boundaries.

**Contains:**

- Why this system exists
- Core functional requirements
- Current scope boundaries
- Key non-functional requirements

**Update when:**

- Requirements change or clarify
- Scope adjustments occur
- New constraints emerge

### 3. Architecture (`.cursor/memory/architecture.md`)

Current system design and technical decisions.

**Contains:**

- Active system components and relationships
- Technology stack and key dependencies
- Current technical constraints
- Design patterns in use

**Update when:**

- Architecture changes
- New dependencies added
- Technical decisions made
- Design patterns evolve

### 4. Work Plan (`.cursor/memory/work-plan.md`)

Active task list and status tracking.

**Contains:**

- Tasks currently in progress
- Tasks ready to start
- Task dependencies and blockers
- What's working vs. what needs building

**Update when:**

- Starting new tasks
- Completing tasks (before archiving)
- Task status changes
- Dependencies resolve

## Session Workflow

### Session Start

1. Read `.cursor/memory/active-context.md` first
2. Check `.cursor/memory/work-plan.md` for current tasks
3. Verify environment state

### During Session

- Update `active-context.md` as work progresses
- Document decisions in relevant files
- Note blockers immediately

### Session End

- Update `active-context.md` with final state
- List next steps clearly
- Update `work-plan.md` with task status

## Key Practices

**Document decisions, not just actions.** Capture *why* choices were made.

**Keep it current.** Active memory reflects the present state, not history.

**Link to archives.** Reference completed work from archive logs when relevant.

**Stay minimal.** Only track active work. Move completed/failed tasks to archives (see [@archive-memory.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/archive-memory.mdc)).

## Integration with Archives

When tasks complete or fail:

1. Update status in `work-plan.md`
2. Trigger archival process ([@archive-memory.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/archive-memory.mdc) handles this)
3. Remove from active tracking once archived

When consulting history:

- Reference `.cursor/memory/task-log.md` for completed work
- Reference `.cursor/memory/plan-log.md` for superseded plans
- Read archived files for detailed context

**Remember: Active memory is your working state. Archives are your history.**
